          <p>Why you see this GOD token on Binance Smart Chain Mainnet?</p>
          <p>
            This token is purely experimental. I've done enough testing on
            testnet and now trying out on mainnet. It only took me less than $1
            to generate the smart contract. There's no purpose for GOD at the
            moment. If you happen to bought the coin by accident or in whatever
            circumstances, then you'll be blessed by GOD and your funds
            definately goes into my personal BSC account according to the smart
            contract. All the details can be found in the

            ended up donated to pay my PHD tuition, an all inclusive Church that
            support LGBTQ+, and various small local unknown people who need some
            help. No tax exemption receipt will be issued. You may track me down
            by seaching "Asvoria Kuan" on Google. As conclusion, this is a
            shitcoin! The chances that GOD turn into another SHIB or DOGE is
            pretty slim! Think before you buy! I simply want to do some
            experiment on mainnet! Seriously!
